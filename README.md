# README

> [!NOTE]
> This repository has become obsolete, as the documentation of the BOOMER algorithm is now directly built from the repository [https://github.com/mrapp-ke/MLRL-Boomer](https://github.com/mrapp-ke/MLRL-Boomer).

This repository contains the documentation of the [BOOMER](https://github.com/mrapp-ke/MLRL-Boomer) machine learning algorithm. The documentation is hosted at [readthedocs.io](https://mlrl-boomer.readthedocs.io/).
